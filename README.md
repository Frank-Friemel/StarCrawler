# StarCrawler
Another Star Wars like Intro Maker

This is more a **Demo** than a serious piece of software. Shows how to:

* use Windows API routine _GetGlyphOutline_
* project 3D objects to a 2D bitplane by CPU (not GPU)
* use `dear imgui` to render a Headup Display with controls
* play encoded (e.g. MP3) audio tracks in realtime
* export a slideshow of images to MP4 video
