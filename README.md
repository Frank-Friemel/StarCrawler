# StarCrawler
Another Star Wars like Intro Maker

This is more a **Demo** than a serious piece of software. Shows how to:

* use Windows API routine _GetGlyphOutline_
* project 3D objects to a 2D bitplane
* use SDL to present a raw bitplane on screen
* play encoded (e.g. MP3) audio tracks in realtime
* export a slideshow of images to MP4 video
